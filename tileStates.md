>Unless player is playing with red fives all tiles exist 4 times without difference in features, red fives do not change during gameplay and such aren't special.

Tiles can be in the follow states during gameplay:

- In Live wall
- In Dead wall{visible, unvisible}
- In players hand
- As part of a chankan
- As part of a regular open {kan,pon or chi}

After gameplay is concluded all tiles can be considered open TODO(sjon): Controleer of dit wel eens klopt, misschien zijn er speciale regels zoals bij poker.
